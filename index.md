### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE  
  **Project: Sentiment Analysis of China’s Education Policy Online Opinion**     Apr.2019 - May.2020
  **Project Leader**|**Advisor**: Ming Li (Professor, School of Economics and Management, CUPB)
· Crawled online textual data on Sina Weibo, built a sentiment analysis model, and performed spatio-temporal visualization analysis
· Analyzed online public opinion after the promulgation of the China’s high school entrance examination postponement policy under COVID-19, and proposed policy recommendations (Python)
- Conclusion: the empirical analysis proves that the online public opinion analysis model of education policy can reflect the evolution of law

  **Project: Research on the Influence Factors of Energy Consumption of Chinese Residents Based on Decision Tree and Panel-corrected Standard Error**                                        Oct.2019 - Dec.2020
  **Advisor**: Xinzhu Zheng (Lecturer, School of Economics and Management, CUPB)
· Analyzed factors influencing energy consumption of Chinese residents using decision tree model based on CGSS 2015 questionnaire
· Compared decision tree and panel-corrected standard error and provided suggestions for the government and residents on energy consumption saving
- Found important factors affecting household electricity consumption in the decision tree approach

 **Project: Study on Improving the Operation Mechanism of China’s Oil Reserve**   Oct.2019 - Dec.2020
   **Advisor**: Xinzhu Zheng (Lecturer, School of Economics and Management, CUPB)
- Analyzed the strategic oil reserve strategies of the United States and France from the perspectives of storage, rotation, and utilization
· Compared China’s strategic oil reserve strategy with that of the United States and France, and proposed policy recommendations
- Conclusion: to achieve efficient and low-cost replenishment of strategic oil reserves, China needs to consider a combination of replenishment prices, procedures, means, and strategies
   
**Book: Be in the Present: Coping and Surviving Low Oil Prices**                  Jul.2020 - Present
  **Advisor**: Jianliang Wang (Associate Professor, School of Economics and Management, CUPB)
· Worked on one chapter about the impact of COVID-19 on global oil markets
- Worked on other chapters about the response of national oil companies to low oil prices
- Found that the global oil price plunge is not a coincidence; national oil companies tend to have a slow response in low oil price situations

**Project: An Analysis of Public Opinions Regarding imported frozen food safety in COVID-19**  Dec.2020 - Present
  **Project Leader**|**Advisor**: Cen Song (Associate Professor, School of Economics and Management, CUPB)
